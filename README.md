# FlaskServer

To run, ensure you have Flask installed. It does not come by default with Python. To install, go to your terminal window, and type in ```pip install flask```.

Once Flask is installed, run FirstFlaskApp.py through a terminal window. You should see a server address at the bottom. This should be something along the lines of 'https://0.0.0.0:5000/'

If you see this, open a web browser and proceed to the site. You should see a page prompting you for login. Press the button to sign up for an account. Enter your desired username and password. When you hit submit, you will notice that two text files have been created in the project's directory; one for usernames, and one for encrypted passwords. You will be redirected to the signup page. Enter the username and password you had just signed up with.

That's it! Feel free to explore the features of the site, such as 2048, a joke generator, and more!
